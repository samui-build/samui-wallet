## A Note on AI-Generated Code

We are supportive of using AI tools to _assist_ your development process (e.g., for boilerplate, optimization suggestions, or debugging).

However, we do not accept "vibe-coded" or purely AI-generated contributions. You must be able to explain, test, and take full ownership of every line of code you submit.

**Pull requests containing code that the author clearly does not understand will be rejected.** You are the developer, not the prompt engineer. All code must be intentional and understood.
