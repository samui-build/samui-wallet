This privacy policy outlines the practices for Samui Wallet ("the App"), provided by Samui ("we," "us," or "our").

### 1. Information We Do Not Collect

We do not require you to create an account, and we do not collect, log, store, or transmit any personal information, such as your name, email address, or phone number.

### 2. Wallet Data (Private Keys)

Your Solana private keys and wallet data are created and stored exclusively on your local device. This information is never sent to our servers, and we do not have access to it. You are solely responsible for the security and backup of your private keys.

### 3. Third-Party Services (Cloudflare)

We use Cloudflare, Inc. (“Cloudflare”) to provide security and deliver our service. Cloudflare may log standard access data, which can include your IP address, browser type, operating system, and request timestamps. This data is used by Cloudflare to operate its service and for security and analytics purposes.

We do not have access to or control over the specific logs retained by Cloudflare. We recommend you review [Cloudflare's Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) for more information on their data practices.

### 4. Data Sharing

We do not share any personal information with third parties because we do not collect any.

### 5. Data Retention and Deletion

As we do not collect or store your personal information or private keys, there is no data for us to retain or delete.

### 6. Children's Privacy

Our service is not directed to individuals under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any information from them.

### 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page.
